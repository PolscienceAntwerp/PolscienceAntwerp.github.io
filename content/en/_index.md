We blog on the use of **flempar**, an R package to retrieve data from the Flemish parliament. **flempar** provides an R interface with the API of the Flemish parliament. 

Please get in contact when you want to contribute your use case to the blog or you want to help in developing the package. The blog is maintained by the [Department of Political Science](https://www.uantwerpen.be/nl/overuantwerpen/faculteiten/faculteit-sociale-wetenschappen/organisatie/departementen/politieke-wetenschap/), University of Antwerp and [Datamarinier](https://datamarinier.be/).
